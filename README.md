# Assignment 1

This repository contains the viewer code and data files you'll need for parts
2-5 of assignment 1. Please refer to "1. First steps with LIBIGL" in the
assignment PDF for instructions on installing and building LIBIGL.

Once LIBIGL is set up (and pointed to by environment variable $LIBIGL_ROOT) you
should be able to build the viewer code:
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
make
```
